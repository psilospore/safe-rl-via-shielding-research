# haskell

Shielding implementation in Haskell.

Uses the sbv library for SMT solving.

## TODO

- [ ] Shielding Loop
- [ ] Perhaps shell out to python when we need the agent part of the shielding loop
- [ ] Traces

## Unicode
I try my best to match unicode to the paper I find that's easier to map even if it might be annoying to setup.
Some unicode characters are prepended with _ for variable names.
If you use emacs you can use latex input mode to type unicode characters.
