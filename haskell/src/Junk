-- | Preemptive Shield iteration
-- Given the time step compute a set of safe actions (remove unsafe actions)
-- Environment executes one action and moves to the next state providing a reward
-- I think the paper describes this more clearly even though this might be harder to use
-- The input alphabet Σᵢ = Σᵢ¹ x Σᵢ² = L x A
-- The output alphabet Σₒ = 2ᴬ
-- Where A is the boolean 'Actions' in the MDP
-- preemptiveShieldIter :: (L, A) -> Set A
-- preemptiveShieldIter (l, a) = undefined


-- | Used for synthesizing the shield
-- Defines a set Fᵍ  ⊆ G of safe states
-- Where win(g₀, g₁, ...) iff ∀i ≥ 0. gᵢ ∈ Fᵍ
-- I think we can solve for this using SMT. In the original implementation they used BDDs.
